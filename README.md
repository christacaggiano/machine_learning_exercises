# Machine Learning Exercises 

These are simple binary classification tasks using logistic regression and a feed-forward neural net (with `keras`). In `obesity_prediction` the neural network example is worked out. In `chest_pain_prediction` the logistic regression example is worked out. For each, please finish the missing neural network or logistic regression, using the examples provided for guidance. Take care to understand the biases in each dataset and how these are played out in the accuracy of the model.
