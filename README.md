# Machine Learning Exercises 

These are simple binary classification tasks using logistic regression and a feed-forward neural net (with `keras`). In `obesity_prediction` the neural network example is worked out. In `chest_pain_prediction` the logistic regression example is worked out. Please for each, finish the missing neural network or logisitc regression, using the examples provided for guidance.
